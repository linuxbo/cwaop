We often find ourselves seeking to defend ourselves against a host of people who aren't even that antagonistic against our causes.
I find myself struggling to explain who I am to an unthinking audience. Who am I and what do I do feeds deeply into what I seek to cause, especially on a greater level than myself.

There's a lot that goes into what we seek to do. Facets of who we are shine through in our ethos, our pathos and our own logos. However, I think that these existential ways that we subscribe to our arguments do not define us. Instead, it is a greater look at who we are and where we place our own values.

Indeed, it's looking to the future that describes who we've been in the past.

For now at the very least, these are my five values:

1. Create confidence.
2. Minimize frustration.
3. Seek to understand.
4. Bring joy.
5. Have a spirit of generosity

Let that demand an answer. Let that be the story of our time.
